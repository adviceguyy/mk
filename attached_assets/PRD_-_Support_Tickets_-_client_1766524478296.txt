UI Components
1. Support Hub (Main View):
   * Grid/List: Displays tickets fetched from GET /api/v1/tickets.
   * Badges: Color-coded status badges (Green=Open, Gray=Resolved).
   * FAB/Button: "+ New Ticket" trigger.
2. Ticket Creation Modal:
   * Inputs: Subject Line, Description (Text Area).
   * Action: POST to /api/v1/tickets.
   * Feedback: Toast notification on success ("Ticket Created"), then auto-refresh list.
3. Ticket Detail View:
   * Chat Interface: History of ticket_messages.
   * Input: "Reply" box at the bottom.
   * Polling/Updates: Re-fetch messages on pull-to-refresh or every 30s.
Functional Logic
* Auth Injection: Every API call must append the Authorization: Bearer <token> header.
* Error Handling: If 401 is returned (Token Expired), trigger the existing silent refresh flow and retry the request.
